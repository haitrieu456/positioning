       <p>Hello, My name is Trieu Hoang and a little about me is that I am a graphic designer and an aspiring software developer studying at Seattle Central College in the Year Up program</p>
       
        <p>For the last 5 years working as a professional in the tech industry, I wanted to come to Year Up in order to elevate my skill and try to get a better job opportunities.</p>
        <p>What I want to achieve from my time here in Year Up are not only for the internship or the certificate, but also the knowledge and the friendship that I'll be able to build while I am here.</p>
        <p>Being an immigrant moving to the US since I was 12, having a goals and an education is hard, so now given this opportunities, I want to try my best to get this intership, focus in school and hopefully one day I can land a good full time job where I can be financially independent.</p>           
        <p>If you have the same dream and drive as I am, please reach out and connect with me through my linkedin above and check out some of my project work on Github.</p>
       <h3>Best Regard</h3>
